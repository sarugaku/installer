THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ABANDONED
===============================

We have decided to stop develop this code base further, and transferred the PyPI project name to [pradyunsg/installer](https://github.com/pradyunsg/installer/), which has a similar scope. Please look into the linked project and [pypa/build](https://github.com/pypa/build/) for replacement of the functionalities offered by this project.

The last working version of this project is stilled installable with

```
pip install installer==0.1.1
```
